# Advance Hand Tracking
Advanced Hand tracking and estimation model using MediaPipe and opencv

## Description

Advanced Hand tracking and estimation model built using MediaPipe and opencv. The model from MediaPipe detects whether the hand is the right or the left hand, furthermore NumPy was used calculate joint angles for kinematic analysis and opencv to read in the live video feed and display the angles.

* Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR): Hand tracking enables more immersive experiences in VR and AR environments. It allows users to interact with virtual objects and environments using their hands, without the need for controllers or other input devices. This enhances the sense of presence and realism in virtual worlds, making interactions more intuitive and natural.

* Sign Language Recognition: Advanced hand tracking can contribute to the development of sign language recognition systems. By accurately capturing and analyzing hand gestures, these systems can translate sign language into written or spoken language, enabling better communication and accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments.

* Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy: Hand tracking technology can assist in rehabilitation and physical therapy programs. By accurately tracking hand movements, therapists can monitor patients' progress and design personalized exercises and rehabilitation plans. It can also be used in virtual rehabilitation scenarios, where patients perform specific hand movements in a virtual environment to aid in their recovery.

* Gaming and Entertainment: Hand tracking can revolutionize gaming experiences by providing more immersive and interactive gameplay. Players can control characters or manipulate virtual objects using hand gestures, adding a new level of engagement and realism to gaming. It can also be used in interactive installations and entertainment venues to create unique and captivating experiences.

* Robotics and Human-Machine Interaction: Hand tracking technology can enhance the interaction between humans and robots. It allows robots to interpret and respond to human hand gestures, enabling more intuitive and natural communication. This can be particularly useful in collaborative settings, such as manufacturing, where humans and robots work together.
